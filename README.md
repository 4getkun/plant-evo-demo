# Neural Flora Demo

## Run locally
Open `index.html` in any modern browser. No build tools or dependencies required.

## Deploy with GitHub Pages
- Push this folder to the `main` branch.
- In GitHub Pages settings, select **main** and **/ (root)**.

## Controls and fitness
- Start/Pause: run or freeze the simulation.
- Fast-forward: 200x time-lapse growth.
- Next Generation: evolve immediately.
- Auto-Evolve: automatically evolve when a generation finishes.
- Reset: restart using the seed value.
- Seed: deterministic RNG seed for reproducible runs.

Fitness rewards:
- Height toward the light source.
- Stability (not tilting too much).
- Efficient branching and leaf area exposed to light.
